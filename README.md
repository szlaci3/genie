I invite you to view a similar web application demo project of mine deployed on Netlify:
https://szlaci3-hr.netlify.app/dist/

The 66Genie web application is using React hooks and the Ant Design component library alongside npm packages like Babel, Webpack, Umi, Moment and React-Router.

The Table page displays the existing data. Observe the fixed header, while you scroll along two axis. Behind the scene, it is a virtual table, so the cells are being added and deleted while they enter and leave the view. This is optimal for a lightweight experience in case of large tables with both many columns and high amount of data.

The Form modal uses many types of input, with relevant validation functionality. It is designed for entering new data.
